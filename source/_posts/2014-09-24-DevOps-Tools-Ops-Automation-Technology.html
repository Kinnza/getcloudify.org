<p>When we discuss the often abused term <a href="http://getcloudify.org/tags/DevOps/" target="_blank">DevOps</a>, we're mostly focusing on two elements: <a href="http://getcloudify.org/cloud_orchestration_cloud_automation.html" target="_blank">automation</a> in the form of deploying apps, and maintaining infrastructure, and culture in the form of collaboration and communication.</p>

<p>The most common gripes we often hear range from anything like "I just can't maintain my shell scripts - they just don't scale" or "Ops are so siloed", "there are too many tools".</p>

<p>There are a thousand ways to do DevOps in any given organization.&#160; Some will say there's no such thing as DevOps tools, and others will say there's no such thing as a DevOps engineer.&#160; This is all true, but there are tools and culturally-minded individuals that help facilitate these processes in organizations.</p>

<p>In advance of the upcoming <a href="http://devopsdays.org/events/2014-telaviv/" target="_blank">DevOps Days Tel Aviv</a> (pssstâ€¦ call for papers is still open) that we are co-organizing &amp; sponsoring, as well as the <a href="http://devopsenterprise.io/" target="_blank">DevOps Enterprise event</a> that we are hoping to plan exciting activities around in partnership with the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/San-Francisco-DevOps/" target="_blank">San Francisco DevOps</a> meetup group - we're going to have a series of posts that focus on a few key elements that have helped us drive a new culture of collaboration and automation at GigaSpaces.</p>

<p>So expect posts on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>What DevOps <strong><em>Isn't</em></strong></p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>How <strong><em>we</em></strong> do DevOps</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Lessons we've learned and how they apply to DevOps</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Tools that help make this happen with some badass hacks</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Things we're doing behind the scenes to help facilitate these processes - in the form of plugins and other development</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>And other stuff as it comes to us</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I'm keeping this post short...so be sure to stay tuned, and <a href="http://getcloudify.org/atom.xml" target="_blank">subscribe </a>to our blog or the <a href="http://getcloudify.org/tags/DevOps/" target="_blank">DevOps</a> tag specifically.</p>

<p>Check out the <a href="http://getcloudify.org/cloudify-roadmap.html" target="_blank">Cloudify Roadmap</a> to find about the new stuff that's landing in our upcoming releases, and if you're daring...play around go the <a href="http://getcloudify.org/downloads/early_access.html" target="_blank">milestone builds</a>, and definitely be sure to let us know what's working and what's not (mailing lists: <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cloudify-users" target="_blank">cloudify-users</a> or <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cloudify-developers" target="_blank">cloudify-developers</a>), and what's still needed through our <a href="https://cloudifysource.atlassian.net/browse/CFY" target="_blank">JIRA </a>project.</p>
