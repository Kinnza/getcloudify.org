<h2> Application installation over the REST API</h2>
Application installation is a process comprised of several steps:
<b>1. Load</b> - Use Groovy to read the DSL and create an Application object
<b>2. Pack</b> - Pack all application files, including extended recipes, to a single file
<b>3. Upload</b> - upload the packed application (and optionally additional files) to the REST server, and getting the upload-keys
<b>4. Deploy</b> - Use the Rest API to deploy the application, using the packed file and the upload key(s)
<b>5. Monitor Progress</b> (optional) - monitor the status of the application until the installation completes

Refer to this example implementation of the above steps:

<h4>Some notes regarding file uploading</h4>
The uploaded files only resides on the server for approximately 5 minutes and are then removed. This mean the upload repo doesn't function as a repository, and the files are expected to be uploaded again the next time you install an application even if it's the same app.
Each upload action returns a unique key, which is what you should use later when actually calling the Rest API to install the application.
The maximum upload size limit for the packed application is 100MB.

Optional file uploads to customize your deployment:
• cloud configuration – File or directory containing configuration information to be used by the cloud driver for this application (file size limited to 10K)
• overrides – File containing properties to be used to override the current properties of the application and its services (limited to 20K)
• cloud overrides – File containing properties to be used to override the current cloud configuration for this application and its services (10K)
