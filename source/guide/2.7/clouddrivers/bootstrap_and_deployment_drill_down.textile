This topic is a drill down into the Openstack cloud driver ( "(newwindow)OpenstackCloudDriver":https://github.com/CloudifySource/cloudify/blob/master/esc/src/main/java/org/cloudifysource/esc/driver/provisioning/openstack/OpenStackCloudifyDriver.java ) 
in the context of the following scenarios:

* *"Bootstrapping a Cloud":#bootstrap * --Allocates machines and installs the Cloudify controller.
* *"Installing an Application":#install * --Allocates machines for application services and installs the application's services (including the Cloudify agent). In this scenario, the cloud driver resides on the management machine as part of the Cloudify controller.<h4 class="info">There is also a *Cluster healing* scenario which is treated by Cloudify as being the same as the *Installing an application* scenario.</h4>
* *"Uninstalling an Application":#uninstall * --Stops the application's services and instructs the cloud driver to uninstall the machines used by the services.
* *"Tearing Down a Cloud":#teardown * --Uninstalls all Cloudify machines and components. 

h2(#bootstrap). Bootstrapping a Cloud

<img src="../../images/clouddrivers/bootstrapping.png"/>

In this scenario, the cloud driver resides on the client machine as no management machines with the Cloudify controller exist. At the Cloudify shell prompt, the user runs the bootstrap command specifying a cloud driver implementation. The cloud driver is instantiated by the shell, and now the shell passes the *Driver Configuration* (org.cloudifysource.dsl.cloud.Cloud) by calling the @setConfig@ method.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2043019.js?file=setConfig.java"></script>

Next, the shell invokes the cloud driver's @startManagementMachines@ method, which is responsible for allocating resources, for instance using a Cloud IaaS API (using the API security settings) to get the required management machines. The cloud API returns an array of MachineDetails (org.cloudifysource.esc.driver.provisioning.MachineDetails) with connction details for each of the allocated management machines. By default, the details are used by the shell to connect to the machines and install the Cloudify management components. A cloud driver may choose to override the default installation process and create a custom one. Finally, Cloudify starts the following Cloudify controller components: Orchestrator(ESM), Deployer(GSM), Discovery(LUS) and the Management Space. It will also start the web management container and the REST API container.

h2(#install). Installing an Application

<img src="../../images/clouddrivers/installApplication.png"/>

In this scenario, the cloud driver resides on the server machine. Once the controller is instructed to install an application, it instructs the cloud driver to start the number of application machines described in the recipe. The cloud driver running in the management machine is first passed an 'Admin' object, using setAdmin() which is useful for querying the current state of the Cloudify cluster. It is then passed the Cloud configuration using setCloud().
Next, the controller invokes the cloud driver's @startMachine@ method, once for each machine that must be provisioned, until all the required machines are up and running with Cloudify agent registered with the LUS, or until the request times out.

The @startMachine@ uses the following steps:
# Call the IaaS API to create a new compute instance.
# Poll the Cloud API until the compute instance becomes available.
# Optionally, 'Ping' the compute instance until it becomes available on the network (this is typically done by attempting to connect to a well-known port like 22 (SSH) or 3389 (RDP).
# Return the details required to connect to the new compute instance, including IP, credentials, etc.
# At this point, the Cloudify controller will install the Cloudify components on the new node.

The driver gets the machine information from the template attributes (corresponding to the requested template name) defined in the configuration object.

The same scenario will occur if the controller has to compensate for a crashed machine or to rebalance one of the services, as shown in the following diagram:

h5(#cscr). Initialization Command 

You can script inline or point to an uploaded script as shown in the following example:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/3946829.js?file=inline.groovy"></script>

h5(#ftr). File Transfer 
 
You can specify how you want to transfer files to the remote machines :  SCP, SFTP or CIFS (Windows file sharing).

<script src="https://gist.github.com/4167436.js?file=fileTransfer.groovy"></script>

h5(#rme). Remote Execution 

You can specify how to execute the remote script: SSH or WinRM

<script src="https://gist.github.com/4167440.js?file=remoteExec.groovy"></script>

h4(#cloudConf). Parameterizing the Cloud Driver

In order to pass configuration information to the Cloud Driver, at the Cloudify shell prompt, type: 

*@install-application@* @-cloudConfiguration PATH_TO_CONF PATH_TO_APPLICATION@
@cloudConfiguration@ contains a path (relative/absolute) to a file or a directory containing configuration information to be used by the cloud driver for this application as shown in the following code snippet:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/3713008.js?file=setCustomDataFile.java"></script>



h2(#uninstall). Uninstalling an Application

<img src="../../images/clouddrivers/uninstallApplication.png"/>

In this scenario, the cloud driver resides on the server machine. Once the controller is instructed to uninstall a deployed application, it stops the application's services and instructs the cloud driver to unininstall the machines used by the services. This is achieved by the controller calling the cloud driver's @stopMachine@ method, which is responsible for deallocating resources, for instance using Cloud IaaS API or a resource pool mechanism. 

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2043076.js?file=stopMachine.java"></script>

The following snippet shows how to call the cloud's IaaS API:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2043089.js?file=terminateServerAPI.java"></script>

h2(#teardown). Tearing Down a Cloud

<img src="../../images/clouddrivers/tearDown.png"/>

In this scenario, the cloud driver resides on the client machine. At the Cloudify shell prompt, the user runs the tear down command specifying a cloud driver implementation to uninstall the management machines. This is achieved by the controller calling the cloud driver's @stopManagementMachines@ method, which in turn calls the cloud's IaaS API and instruct it to stop the relevant machines.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2043105.js?file=stopManagement.java"></script>
