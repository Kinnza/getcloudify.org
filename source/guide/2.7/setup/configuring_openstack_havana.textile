This topic provides instructions for configuring Openstack Havana Cloud for Cloudify.

h2. Prerequisites

* An Openstack cloud account
* Cloudify shell (for information about installing the Cloudify shell, see "Installing the Cloudify Shell":../setup/installing_the_cloudify_client.html)

h2. Configuring an Openstack Havana Cloud

This section provides step-by-step instructions for the following configuration tasks:

# "Generate a private key":#key
# "Configure the Cloudify cloud driver configuration file":#driver

h3(#key). Generate a private key

# In the Openstack web console, under "Keypairs":https://horizon.hpcloud.com/project/access_and_security/, click *Create Keypair*, and then type a name for the key pair.

# Copy the key and save it as a @.pem@ private key file (e.g. @myKeyPair-name.pem@) in the @<cloudifyRoot>/clouds/openstack-havana/upload@ folder.

h4(info). The private key enables the Cloudify cloud driver to open SSH connections to the newly created instances.

h3(#driver). Configure the Cloudify cloud driver configuration file

Edit the Openstack cloud driver configuration file (@openstack-havana-cloud.properties@) located in the @<cloudifyRoot>/clouds/openstack-havana/@ folder, and modify the following properties:
* *user* is actually the user name and is listed on the top right corner in the horizon dashboard.
   The user is the same value which is used as 'User Name' when you login to the "(newwindow)Openstack console":https://horizon.hpcloud.com/auth/login/.
* *tenant* is the project's name which is listed on the top left corner in the horizon dashboard.

* *apiKey* is actually the password that you use when you login to the "(newwindow)Openstack console":https://horizon.hpcloud.com/auth/login/.
* *keyFile* -- Specify the name of the private key file that you created (for example: @myKeyPair-name.pem@).
* *keyPair* -- Specify the name of the Keypair that you created, whose content is in the .pem file (*keyFile* from above).
* *openstackUrl* -- Specify the endpoint url. 
  For example: *openstackUrl*="https://<IP>:5000/v2.0/"
* *hardwareId* -- Specify the hardwareId (inclduing region).
  For example: *hardwareId*="RegionOne/2"
* *imageId* -- Specify the image Id (including region).
  For example: *imageId*="RegionOne/122"
* *availabilityZone* -- Specify the availability zone.
  For example: *availabilityZone*="az1"
  This setting is mandatory if block storage functionality is required.

<h4 class="impt">You can set the cloud driver directly as shown in the following example (of an @openstack-havana-cloud.groovy@ file), but we reccomend that you use "parameterization of the cloud driver configuration":../clouddrivers/cloud_driver.html#gstr, </h4>

h2. Bootstrapping Openstack OpenStack Cloud

h3. Prerequisites

Before you bootstrap your Openstack Havana Cloud, make sure that your environment meets all the minimum requirements. For more information, see "Bootstrapping Prerequisites":../bootstrapping/bootstrapping_process.html#prereqs.

h3. Bootstrapping

Bootstrapping Openstack Havana Cloud is extremely simple:
# Start the Cloudify shell -- For information about running the Cloudify shell, see "Installing the Cloudify Shell":../setup/installing_the_cloudify_client.html
# Start the bootstrapping process for provisioning machines for Cloudify management -- At the Cloudify shell prompt, type: *@bootstrap-cloud@* *@openstack-havana@*
  <h4 class="info">Once the command completes, the URL of the Cloudify web management console and the Cloudify contoller's REST endpoint are display in the shell. Also, the shell automatically connects to the controller as part of the bootstrap process, so you don't have to explicitly type the @connect@ command.</h4>

h3(#tear). Teardown

To shut down the Openstack Havana Cloud environment, at the Cloudify shell prompt, type: *@teardown-cloud@* @openstack-havana@

h4(info). This uninstalls applications and shuts down all the management and service instance machines.
