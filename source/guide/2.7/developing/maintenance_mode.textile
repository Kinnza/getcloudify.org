h2. Enabling/Disabling host machine failure detection

Setting a service instance to maintenance mode will disable host machine failure detection for that specific service instance. 
This means that during the specified time period, a failure or a restart of a service instance host machine will *NOT* result in a provisioning of a new machine and service instance. 

To invoke the start maintenance mode on a specific service instance using the service context, use: *context.startMaintenanceMode(10l, TimeUnit.MINUTES)*

To invoke the stop maintenance mode on a specific service instance using the service context, use:  *context.stopMaintenanceMode()*

You can also set all service instances to maintenance mode using the CLI and built-in custom commands.
The following command will set all service instances to maintenance mode for five minutes : 
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  *invoke &lt;serviceName&gt; cloudify:start-maintenance-mode 5*

The following command will stop maintenance mode for all service instances : 
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  *invoke &lt;serviceName&gt; cloudify:stop-maintenance-mode*

Setting a single service instance to maintenance mode requires an invocation of the start/stop call on the specific instance alone or calling the service context method and specifying only a specific service instance. 
The following command will set a specific service instance to maintenance mode for five minutes : *invoke <[serviceName]-[instanceNumber]> cloudify:start-maintenance-mode 5*
