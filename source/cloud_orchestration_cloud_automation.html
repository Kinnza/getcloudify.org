						<h1><strong>Introducing Cloudify 3.0</strong></h1>
						<h2>Orchestrate Real Apps on the Cloud with Cloudify</h2>
						<p> Achieve a smooth transition to the cloud and easy automation of even the most complex applications throughout their entire lifecycle with Cloudify. Orchestrate the creation of the whole cloud infrastructure required for your application, starting from compute resources all the way down to networks and block storage devices. Cloudify will then deploy your applications to the cloud (<a href="/openstack-architecture-cloudify.html">OpenStack</a>, VMWare vSphere, or even bare metal like Softlayer), monitor their progress and scale them when needed.</p>
						<p>With Cloudify, you won’t be locked into a specific cloud provider or one type of cloud; deploy the same application in your own data center or on the cloud of your choice using your favorite automation and configuration management tools. Monitor, manage and scale your application with Cloudify, whatever the topology or technology stack.</p>

					<h1><strong>Intelligent orchestration</strong> of applications on the cloud.</h1>
					<p>Most automation  tools are focused on the installation and configuration phases of application management, while in reality much of the management takes place after the application has been deployed.</p>
					<p>Cloudify was redesigned to eliminate the boundaries between orchestration and monitoring, providing a mechanism to automatically react to monitored events with the appropriate corrective measures. Version 3.0 includes these building blocks of custom workflows, based on a workflow engine and a modeling language that enables the automation of any process and any stack. Version 3.1 will introduce monitoring and custom policies for automated triggering of such corrective measures to provide auto-healing and auto-scaling capabilities.</p>

								<p><strong><font color="#00B4DA" style="font-size:16px;">Integrating Your Entire Automation and Monitoring Tool Chain</font></strong></p>
								<p>A typical automated environment does not end with configuration management; it typically involves a diverse and varying toolchain to manage provisioning, configuration management, logging & monitoring, real-time analytics and workflow automation.</p>
								<p>Cloudify brings together a variety of tools that are used throughout the different stages of the application lifecycle:</p>
								<ul>
								<li>Configuration management tools, such as Chef, Puppet, Fabric and Docker</li>
								<li>Infrastructure orchestration tools, such as OpenStack Heat</li>
								<li>Logging and monitoring tools, such as logstash and Elasticsearch</li>
								<li>Real-time analytics tools, such as Reimann.io</li>
								</ul>
								<p>In doing so, Cloudify promotes common industry best practices, making it easy to integrate and use best of breed tools to manage your environment. In addition, Cloudify 3.0 comes with a new plug-in architecture that enables you to easily  integrate a wide range of tools for monitoring, configuration management and cloud infrastructure.</p>

								<p><strong><font color="#00B4DA" style="font-size:16px;">Support for VMware, CloudStack, SoftLayer and other clouds</font></strong></p>
								<p>Cloudify 3.0 has built-in plug-ins for Apache CloudStack and VMware vSphere, (with vCloud and SoftLayer coming soon). It also comes with an open plug-in architecture to support other clouds such as Amazon AWS, GCE, CloudStack as well as Linux containers such as Docker (plug-ins that will all be released in the coming few weeks). With Cloudify 3.0, it is now possible to span the same application across multiple cloud environments without creating a new Cloudify setup per environment. This is useful for users who are transitioning from their existing environment into a cloud environment, and also for allowing bursting and simple hybrid cloud deployments between OpenStack, VMware, Amazon and other clouds.</p>

								<h3><strong>Native Integration with OpenStack</strong></h3>
								<p>As OpenStack is fast becoming the defacto standard for private clouds, Cloudify 3.0 was redesigned for even tighter integration with OpenStack technology and core services, including KeyStone, Neutron, Nova and Heat. The underlying design of Cloudify was also re-architected to match the design principles of OpenStack services, including the rewriting of the core services in Python and leveraging common infrastructure building blocks such as RabbitMQ.</p>

								<h3><strong>TOSCA Support</strong></h3>
								<p><a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=tosca" target="_blank">TOSCA (Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications)</a> is a specification that allows users  to describe any set of automation processes on cloud applications with an extensible  set of hooks and component types. Cloudify 3.0 uses a YAML-based orchestration template driven by the TOSCA specification. The next release of Cloudify will include full syntax compatibility with the TOSCA specification as soon as it becomes officially supported.</p>

								<h4><strong>Multiple applications that can span thousands of nodes</strong></h4>
								<p>Managing and monitoring of an application requires tight integration with the application to enable quick failure-detection, scaling and other reactive actions. As this makes orchestration tasks heavier, many existing orchestration tools are limited by their monitoring and orchestration engine. This is particularly challenging with big data or networking services that can span to thousands of instances for a single deployment.</p>
								<p>Cloudify 3.0 provides management and monitoring of large scale applications using a message broker, such as RabbitMQ, to manage the communication with its managed instances and a logging and analysis engine, through logstash and Elasticsearch, for big data scale.</p>

								<h4><strong>New Topology-Driven Monitoring</strong></h4>
								<p>Many existing monitoring tools were designed to monitor applications only after they have been deployed. In a DevOps environment in which the application continuously changes, sometimes hundreds of times each day, keeping the monitoring system in sync with the actual application deployment is a challenge. As the monitoring systems are often not equipped to map the application topology and architecture, complex and error-prone discovery models are needed to map the application deployment and the dependencies of its components.</p>
								<p>Cloudify 3.0 introduces a new concept of topology-driven monitoring in which the entire application management and tracking system is centralized around the application topology, rather than the infrastructure. This makes it possible, at any given moment, to track not only the state of the application, but also the status of deployment, updates, and scaling processes through a single view. As the monitoring system is integrated with the orchestration engine, the two systems are always in sync and up to date, eliminating the need to rely on external discovery services.</p>
